# Hacking Terminal Simulator ðŸ’»

Ever wanted to feel like a 2000s movie hacker without actually going to jail? Boom. Here's your personal hacking terminal â€” green text, blinking cursor, shady commands â€” all drama, zero consequences.

## What is this?
This is a simple (but super cool) HTML + CSS + JavaScript project that:
* Types out "hacking" steps automatically
* Adds random typing delays to make it realistic
* Ends with a *blinking cursor* like you're ready to enter more "top secret" commands
* Makes you look 1000% cooler instantly. Trust me.

## Features âœ¨
* Typing animation that feels alive
* Random speed between keystrokes (because no one types perfectly)
* Cool neon green "Matrix-style" glow
* Realistic blinking cursor at the end
* Super lightweight â€” just open in your browser and flex

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Watch as your screen fills with "hacker" commands
4. Feel like you're in a Hollywood movie about cybersecurity

## Code Breakdown
The simulator uses:
- **HTML**: Basic structure
- **CSS**: Terminal styling with glow effects
- **JavaScript**: Async functions for realistic typing animation
